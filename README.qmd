# Executive Summary

**Dataset**

This project utilizes data collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project. The Open Policing Project is a national repository of police vehicle and pedestrian stops and searches. This project specifically examines traffic stops in Camden, New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The data was pulled from each city's respective police department and cleaned by staff members at the Open Policing Project. The cleaned data file includes 195,100 traffic stops performed by Camden Police Department between April 2013 and January 2020, and 1,865,096 traffic stops performed by Philadelphia Police Department between December 2013 to April 2018. Each observation in this dataset represents a single traffic stop. Both datasets include information on the outcome of the stop, latitude and longitudinal data on where the stop occurred, and demographic data on the person stopped.

We wrangled the data to match the following criteria:

-   Filtered to include just vehicular stops and to exclude pedestrian stops

-   Filtered to include dates that overlapped across both jurisdictions, this includes the time frame of January 1, 2014 - December 31, 2017

-   Recoded the raw age variables to match Census age groups

-   Limited the data to include only stops that occurred within the geographic bounds of Camden and Philadelphia

**Research Question**

How do police traffic stops and outcomes vary by demographic groups (i.e. race/ethnicity, age, gender) in two geographically adjacent cities?

Our goal is to help both policymakers and citizens understand what policing looks like in their communities. Accountability in policing is crucial, and information empowers us to act when we can see how inequities manifest, especially between different racial identities.

**Methodology**

*Dashboard with Maps*

The first step of our analysis was to create an interactive dashboard to visualize traffic stops in both jurisdictions across demographic groups. We used a Quarto shiny file to render a dashboard with a general interactive sidebar that can be used to select a time frame in years and location of stops to view. The dashboard also includes the following tabs to allow for visualization of characteristics of individual stops:

-   [Outcomes of Stops:]{.underline} arrests, citation, no outcome (i.e., person was let off), warning

    -   Note: Philadelphia data only contains outcome information on arrests and no outcome from the stop

-   [Race of Driver Stopped:]{.underline} Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, White

    -   Note: We exclude other or unknown from this tab for ease of visualization

-   [Gender of Driver Stopped:]{.underline} Female or Male

    -   Note: We recognize that gender is not a binary, however, this is how the data was captured and reported on

-   [Age of Driver:]{.underline} This dashboard includes buckets of age groups aligned with census outcomes

*Static Visuals of Differences in Stops by Race/Ethnicity*

In addition to developing a dashboard, we also created several visualizations to dive deeper into potential differences between racial and ethnic groups in both locations. To do this we created the following static:

-   [Stacked bar charts:]{.underline} These stacked bar charts show the proportion of stops by race per year across both locations

-   [Line charts:]{.underline} These line charts show the change in stops per 100 population for black and white drivers over time. This was calculated by dividing the number of stops per race by their overall population in that jurisdiction and multiplying it by 100.

*Interactive Maps Using Uber's H3 Package*

We used Uber's hexagon package to visualize aggregate stops. This package was used to create chloropleth maps of the following cross-tabulations over the full time period:

-   Black stops in Philadelphia

-   White stops in Philadelphia

-   Black stops in Camden

-   White stops in Camden
